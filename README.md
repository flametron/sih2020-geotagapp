# Smart India Hackathon 2020 - GeoTag App Prototype

## Problem Statement

Develop a mobile application for recording and playing geotagged videos. Unlike photos in which geotag data is of a single point and orientation pair, for videos geotag data is a sequence of point and orientation pairs. The mobile application should have two views. In one view, the recorded video should play while simultaneously plotting field-of-view (orientation) cone and marker on an interactive map in the order view in a synchronized manner. The position shown on the map should match the play position of the videos.

According to the problem statement, the main idea is to create a mobile application for recording and playing geotagged videos. When we take a picture on our phone, not only does the photo get stored but also some other information about the photo, like camera details, shutter speed, aperture, etc. are stored. Also among these datas, one vital information stored is the geo-tagged location of the place where the photo was taken.

Similarly, for a video, the location of the video is also stored but consider a person traveling from one location to another. In that case, the geotag will be at the starting or ending point. For this problem, we need to develop an application that can record and play videos having dynamic geotag which means the path of the rover/camera recording the video will also be stored.
